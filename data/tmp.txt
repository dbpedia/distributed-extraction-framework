This file is here because an empty data/ directory cannot be added to github. And the zip files that are part of this directory should not be pushed to github as
that won't make sense either. The only option was to either add contents of this directory to the .gitignore file so that the directory is pushed but not the
contents or put this dummy file in here to satisfy the needs of the octocat. And this folder is mandatory to have as this is what specified in the template
files and I don't want my template files to fail and the end user to panic. 

Thus this file was created...
